with Firebase Authentication. If you are curious about the corresponding privacy, it is linked 
[here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/).
Apart from the username and the account id, all the information used to log in will be forwarded to 
the authentication service and will neither be read nor saved by the app itself.

## What information is stored?
